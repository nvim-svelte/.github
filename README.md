Enhancing the Svelte and SvelteKit development experience in Neovim.

## About

The nvim-svelte organization is dedicated to creating and maintaining high-quality Neovim
plugins that improve the developer experience when working with Svelte and SvelteKit
projects. Our goal is to build a collection of tools that integrate seamlessly with
Neovim's ecosystem while providing Svelte-specific functionality.

## Getting Started

The nvim-svelte organization is just starting up! We're in the early stages of building
tools to enhance the Svelte development experience in Neovim and are actively looking for
collaborators and contributors who share our passion for these technologies.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're interested in:

- Developing new Svelte-focused Neovim plugins
- Improving existing plugins
- Fixing bugs or adding features
- Writing documentation

If you're passionate about both Svelte and Neovim, we'd love to have you join us. Feel
free to open issues, submit pull requests, or reach out about collaborating on new
projects.
